*** A state machine using Verilog ***

The state machine is implemented using 2 always blocks

The 2 blocks are the Sequential Block + the Combinational Block

Finite state machines are referred to by the acronym FSM

FSMs can also be implemeted with 1 or 3 always blocks

In our example we've implemented the FSM with 2 always blocks
